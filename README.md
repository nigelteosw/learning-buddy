# learning-buddy

A Chrome side-panel that turns any page into a personalized tutor: highlight text → get a plain-English explanation, analogy, or step-by-step, save tough bits as spaced-repetition cards, and practice them later — all running locally via Chrome’s built-in AI. (Cloud fallback optional.)
